This is a simple function that computes the inverse of a matrix
using Gaussian-Jordan elimination.  Obviously it is suffers of round
of errors but when multiplying the start and computed inverse it results
in the identity matrix to about 10 decimal places which is good enough for me.


All the tests pass (currently it tests for equality within 0.0000000001)
and valgrind says it's good as well.
